<tr>
<td><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>1.&nbsp; <b>EMPATHY</b> - simply
putting yourself in “his shoes”.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>2.&nbsp; <b>SIMPLE LANGUAGE</b>
- you are not trying to impress the probationer with your fabulous vocabulary.&nbsp;
You are trying to effectively communicate with him.&nbsp; Be aware of his
terminology and discuss on the level that he can understand.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>3.&nbsp; <b>PROBATIONER’S IDENTIFY!</b>
- be careful to your mannerism, set a good example; if you are effectively
reaching him he will emulate much in the same manner as a son copies a
father.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>4.&nbsp; <b>ADVICE </b>- in order
to be accepted it must be given from his point of view.&nbsp; This is where
empathy and understanding is paramount.&nbsp; Can he use the advice or
is it impossible?&nbsp; If the latter is true this sets up a road block.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>5.&nbsp; <b>LISTENING</b> - one
of the most basic requirements of a good counselor it is that he or she
is a good listener.&nbsp; (For most of us this a very difficult task).&nbsp;
Be objective.&nbsp; There is a difference in listening to a person and
actually hearing what he has to say.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>6.&nbsp; <b>RESPECT FOR CLIENT</b>
- respect the offender and his basic right as a fellow human being.&nbsp;
He has transgressed the law, but when you get down to actual facts, who
of us has not.&nbsp; He needs to be viewed with dignity and there is no
room for narrow prejudices.&nbsp; Basically, you must like the person in
order to deal with him effectively.&nbsp; Many times his moral are different
form yours, but remember, he has different sense of values and has been
exposed to an environment that is foreign to you in many cases.&nbsp; If
you dislike a probationer or have personality conflicts with which you
cannot resolve, do not hesitate to request that you be taken off the case.&nbsp;
This is far more honorable than struggling under irremovable pressures.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>7.&nbsp; <b>ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER
THAN WORDS </b>- the offender readily recognizes your sincerity , or lack
of it.&nbsp; It is not so important what you say, but how you say it.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>8.&nbsp; <b>HIGH EXPECTIONS </b>-
think positively regardless of the shortcomings of the probationer.&nbsp;
Exploit his strong points and strengthen his weaknesses.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;9.&nbsp; <b>USE OF AUTHORITY</b>
- the authoritarian figure is vested in the professional supervisor.&nbsp;
Your strongest authority will be your ability to convey your psychological
strengths as you have the expertise of knowing how to get along in the
world successfully and the probationer does not or has not.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>10.&nbsp; <b>INSPIRATIONAL</b> -
be enthusiastic!&nbsp; Show your leadership and depict good examples of
strong character and humbleness in your successes.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>11.&nbsp; <b>CAUSE DISCOMFORT</b>
- if a person remains frustrated long enough he will find a way of adapting
to the situation.&nbsp; (An example is the “gaddy daddy or non-support
individual who rationalizes his position of not paying child support until
he finally feels it is not his duty to do so.)&nbsp; Exploit frustration
and discomfort when you can see a client is not satisfied with his lot
in life.&nbsp; Make him comfortable so as to challenge and motivate him
in the right direction.&nbsp; Challenge him to do something about it if
he is not satisfied.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>12.&nbsp; <b>GUILT FEELINGS</b>
- probationers may not be as sensitive to feeling of guilt as you are.&nbsp;
We need to generate appropriate guilt feelings in the individual as this
serves as a deterrent to further law violations.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>13.&nbsp; <b>USE OF CRISIS</b> -
the criminal offender is accustomed to being defeated and overcome by crisis.&nbsp;
However, the volunteer counselor is in the position to stand by and assist
him during a crisis.&nbsp; Habitual defeat can sometimes be turned into
a learning process and final victory.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>14.&nbsp; <b>PERSISTENCE</b> - is
a very important part of counseling.&nbsp; It shows the probationer that
we will not give up on him.&nbsp; He himself expects to be disappointment.&nbsp;
When he realizes that you are genuinely interested in helping, often time
this will serve as a turning point in his behavioral pattern.</font></font></td>
