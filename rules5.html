<td><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>Probation was actually started
by a volunteer about 130 years ago in Boston, Massachusetts.&nbsp; John
Augustus, a shoemaker by trade, watched a common drunkard being sentenced
to jail.&nbsp; He had the opportunity to convey with the man and became
convinced the man could remain sober if given a chance.&nbsp; Augustus
stood bail for the man and he was released by the Court and ordered to
appear back in three weeks for sentencing.&nbsp; At that time, he seemed
so reformed that instead of the usual penalty of imprisonment he was fined
one cent and ordered to pay all costs.&nbsp; Augustus was so encouraged
that he continued to stand bail for offenders for the next 18 years. Augustus
developed many of the features which are characteristic of the Probation
System used today.&nbsp; He selected men for probation who were first offenders
and he made a thorough examination of each individual history.&nbsp; This
is done today by the use of Pre-Sentence Investigation.&nbsp; Offenders
under Augustus’ supervision were either sent to school or supplied with
honest work.&nbsp; He also made impartial reports to the Court and maintained
a careful register of all his cases.&nbsp; Each of these things is to this
day part to the procedure of the Probation Office.&nbsp; He opened the
door to a new concept of helping offenders rather than merely punishing
them.</font></font></td>

The offenses are various and include such charges as DWI’s, theft, narcotic
violations, burglary and robbery.&nbsp; Most offenders are average citizens
with normal problems.&nbsp; The way in which they handled their problems
have not always been within the law.&nbsp; They are people that we come
into contact with on an everyday basis while they are serving time in the
community.</font></font></td>
