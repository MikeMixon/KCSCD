<tr>
<td>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>1.&nbsp; <b>JOBS</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Encourage job stability,
punctuality, regular attendance productiveness, proper notice for employment
changes, regular employment and other job-connected responsibilities.&nbsp;
Assist in upgrading the under-employed who are not working up to his order
employment potential. Help generate interest and motivate the probationer
to participate in vocational training.&nbsp; Identify vocational interest
and aptitude through discussions and testing by local community resources
such as Texas Employment Commission, Texas Vocational Rehabilitation Commission,
Adult Education, Vocational Schools and other means.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>2.&nbsp; <b>EDUCATION</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Encourage and motivate toward
completion of high school.&nbsp; Suggest regular academic pursuits or completion
of necessary requirements for General Equivalency (GED) Diploma.&nbsp;
Enrollment in college programs and other educational programs is important
when potential and interest is present.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>3.&nbsp; <b>LISTEN</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;One of the foremost qualifications
of a good one-to-one volunteer is the ability to be a good listener.&nbsp;
Much constructive therapy is administered through the art of merely allowing
a person to “talk out” his or her problems.&nbsp; The venting of feeling
offers great promise judgment and moralize.&nbsp; Determine his interests
and encourage him to channel them and his energies into socially acceptable
paths.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>4.&nbsp; <b>RELIGION</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Religious and spiritual growth
can provide the ingredients for a balanced and secure future.&nbsp; Character
guidance and moral values which are grounded in religious beliefs, can
help strengthen the offender’s internal resources.&nbsp; Volunteers may
encourage church attendance and provide counseling in areas within the
offenders own denominational preferences.&nbsp; (VOLUNTEERS SHOULD NOT
PROPOUND THEIR OWN DENOMINATIONAL BELIEFS BUT LEAVE THIS TO THE OFFENDERS
OWN CHOOSING.)</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>5.&nbsp; <b>INSPIRE</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Pointing out strengths and
enthusiastic encouragement with an occasional “pat on the back” motivated
many people to do their very best.&nbsp; The offender is not exception
to the rule and he needs to experience some successes to bolster his ego,
instill pride, and inspire greater achievement.&nbsp; Good influence change
attitudes, appearance, mannerism, dress and other factors conducive to
good adjustment.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>6.&nbsp; <b>FRIEND</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;“In poverty and other misfortunes
of life, true friends are a sure refuge.”&nbsp; “The young they keep out
of mischief; to the old, they are comfort and aid in their weakness, and
those in prime of life they insight to noble deeds.”&nbsp; Aristotle</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>7.&nbsp; <b>RESOURCES</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Probationer’s seldom have
developed hobbies and healthy recreational pursuits or cultural interest.&nbsp;
Citizen volunteers can help broaden the offenders perspective and interest
through exposure to cultural events, sports programs and other community
activities which assist in self-improvement and enjoyment</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>8.&nbsp; <b>ALCOHOL</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;The use of alcohol contributes
to the plight of many law violators.&nbsp; Encouragement toward attendance
at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, counseling with family, and fostering
self-control provide services to offenders.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>9.&nbsp; <b>NARCOTICS</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;The abuse of drugs is a growing
menace to the viability of our society especially in regard to the youth.&nbsp;
Counseling in prevention, control and the dangers of drug abuse are important
areas of concentration.&nbsp; New interests and associates can assist in
overcoming problems of drug addiction and alcoholism.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>10.&nbsp; <b>PERSONAL CONTACTS</b></font></font>
<br><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Personal contacts are important
in rehabilitating criminal offenders.&nbsp; They need to know that someone
cares and is interested in their future.&nbsp; Often they have not had
the advantage of parental encouragement, direction, interest, or concern.&nbsp;
Frequent and regular office contacts by the volunteer helps solidify their
relationship, gain confidence and depict genuine interest.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>The above suggestions are not all
inclusive and are intended to point out only a few areas of concentration.&nbsp;
One-to-one volunteers may be involved in any combination of the above and
in a host of other areas.&nbsp; By identifying the problems and assisting
the offender in arriving at constructive solutions, the volunteer can make
significant contributions in stabilizing the offender.</font></font></td>
